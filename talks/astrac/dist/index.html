  ## What is Scala?
]
.right-column[
  Scala is a concise, modern, multi-paradigm, statically-typed language

  - Created by Martin Odersky (main contributor for the JVM generics support)

  - Supported by Typesafe and the EPFL (École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne)

  - Runs on the JVM

  - Seamlessly interoperate with existing Java libraries

  - Blends Object Oriented and Functional programming

  - Advanced support for concurrency and distributed systems

  - Still young but gaining traction in the industry

  ## What is Scala?
  ### Type inference
]
.right-column[
  Type inference reduce the noise in your code by making optional obvious type annotations:

  In Java:
  ```java
  int n = 42;
  String s = "The answer";

  Map<String, Integer> m =
    new HashMap<String, Integer>();
  l.put(s, n);
  ```

  In Scala using the type inference:
  ```scala
  val n = 42
  val s = "A string"
  val m = Map(s -> n)
  ```

  In Scala with explicit type annotations:
  ```scala
  val n: Int = 42
  val s: String = "A string"
  val m: Map[String, Int] = Map(s -> n)
  ```

  ### Boilerplate reduction in class definitions
]
.right-column[
  A typical Java "Person" class

  ```java
  public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Person(String name, int age) {
      this.name = name;
      this.age = age;
    }

    public String getName() {
      return name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
      return age;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
      this.name = name;
    }

    public void setAge(int age) {
      this.age = age;
    }
  }
  ```
]
---
.left-column[
  ## What is Scala?
  ### Boilerplate reduction in class definitions
]
.right-column[
  Same example in Scala

  ```scala
  class Person(var name: String, var age: Int)
  ```

  With custom getter/setter:
  ```scala
  class Person(var name: String, private var _age: Int) {

    def age = _age // Getter

    def age_=(newAge: Int) { // Setter
      println(s"Setting age to $newAge")
      _age = newAge
    }
  }
  ```

  In general this is not how value-object modelling works in Scala.

  As we are going to see when talking about Functional Programming immutability
  and *case classes* are preferred to getters and setters:

  ```scala
  case class Person(name: String, age: Int)
  ```
]

.left-column[
  ## What is Scala?
  ### Variable definitions
]
.right-column[
  Variables can be defined as val or var:

  - *val* are constants.

    ```scala
    val answer = 42
    // ...
    answer = 43 // Compile error
    ```

    - vals can also be *lazy*, in which case their value will be computed only
      when accessed the first time.

      ```scala
      lazy val x = "Some big computation"
      ```

  - *var* are variables

    ```scala
    var x = "Initialization value"
    // ...
    x = "Some other value" // Compiles
    ```

    - vars are usually discouraged in public APIs as immutability is always
      preferred.
    - They are useful when correctly encapsulated to simplify otherwise
      complex logic or when they make it easier to achieve better performances.

  ## What is Scala?
  ### Function invocations
]
.right-column[
  Basic function definition:

  ```scala
  def foo(bar: String, baz: String) {
    println(s"Bar: $bar - Baz: $baz")
  }

  foo("A", "B") // prints "Bar: A - Baz: B"
  ```

  Default parameters and named parameter invocations:

  ```scala
  def foo(bar: String = "A", baz: String = "B") {
    println(s"Bar: $bar - Baz: $baz")
  }

  foo()    // prints "Bar: A - Baz: B"
  foo("C") // prints "Bar: C - Baz: B"
  foo(baz = "D") // prints "Bar: A - Baz: D"
  ```

  Despite having a `return` keyword, its use is discouraged. The value returned
  by a function and in general the value of any block is the last value encountered
  in the block.

.left-column[
  ## What is Scala?
  ### Pure OO
]
.right-column[
  Everything is an object, no primitive types

  ```scala
  val one = 1.toString // -> "1"
  ```

  Every operation is a method call, so these two statements are equivalent:

  ```scala
  val six = 1 + 2 + 3 // -> 6
  ```

  ```scala
  val six = 1.+(2).+(3) // -> 6
  ```

  Syntactic sugar allow omission of **.** and **( )**, so these two statements
  are equivalent as well:

  ```scala
  val c = "Something".charAt(1) // Returns 'o'
  ```

  ```scala
  val c = "Something" charAt 1 // Returns 'o'
  ```
]
---
.left-column[
  ## What is Scala?
  ### Classes
]
.right-column[
  Classes in Scala are purely dynamic (i.e. no static keyword) and can be abstract.
  Class definition works pretty much in the same way as in Java:

```scala
abstract class Animal(val name: String) {
  def speak(): Unit // abstract method
  override def toString = name // override is required
}

class Cat extends Animal("cat") {
  override def speak() { // override here is optional
    println("Meow!")
  }
}

val cat = new Cat // Instantiation
val dog = new Animal("dog") { // Anonymous class
  override def speak() { println("Woof!") }
}

cat.speak() // prints Meow!
dog.speak() // prints Woof!
```

  The equivalent of Java's **Object** is **Any**: all classes inherit from it. There is also
  a type named **Nothing** which inherits from all the classes (more on this later).

  ## What is Scala?
  ### Traits
]
.right-column[
  Traits are the Scala equivalent of interfaces, but they allow for concrete
  implementations as well and it is still possible to mix multiple traits in the
  same class:

```scala
trait Animal {
  def call: String
  def speak() {
    println(call)
  }
}

trait Flying {
  def fly() {
    println("I'm flying!")
  }
}

class Bird extends Animal with Flying {
  def call = "cheep"
}

val b = new Bird

b.speak() // prints "cheep"
b.fly() // prints "I'm flying!"
```
]

.left-column[
  ## What is Scala?
  ### Singleton objects
]
.right-column[
  As classes do not have a static part Scala has a special keyword for singleton objects.

  A singleton object can have the same name as a class, in which case it is defined
  as **companion object**.

  The main difference between a singleton object and a static class in Java is that
  singleton objects can extend classes and traits.

```scala
trait SayHello {
  def name: String
  def message = "Hello " + name + "!"
}

object Hello extends SayHello {
  override def name = "world"

  def world() {
    println(message)
  }
}

Hello.world() // prints "Hello world!"
```
]
---
.left-column[
  ## What is Scala?
  ### Implicit conversions
]
.right-column[
  Scala supports *implicit conversions* to enrich types by importing definitions
  in scope.

  An implicit conversion is a function that takes an argument of a type and returns
  an argument of another type.

  Implicit conversions will be applied at compile-time when referring to a method
  or a property that doesn't exist in the base type but exists in the converted one.

```scala
class RichString(s: String) {
  def twice = s + s
}

object RichString {
  implicit def toRichString(s: String) =
    new RichString(s)
}

object HelloTwice {
  import RichString._

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    println("Hello World!\n".twice)
  }
}
```

## What is Functional Programming?

  ## What is Functional Programming?
]
.right-column[
Functional Programming is a style of programming which models computations as
the evaluation of expressions. The building blocks of Functional Programming are
*pure functions*.

A function is *pure* when it will not perform any side effects, thus giving the
same output value for the same input arguments independently from when or how many
times it has been invoked. Side effects can be anything like:

- Reassigning a variable
- Modifying a data structure in place
- Setting a field on an object
- Throwing an exception or halting with an error
- Printing to the console or reading user input
- Reading from or writing to a file
- Drawing on the screen

**Functional programming is a restriction on how we write programs, but not on what
programs we can express.**
]

.left-column[
  ## What is Functional Programming?
  ### Benefits
]
.right-column[
Programming by pure functions helps building software that is **easier to test** as
side effects are separated from the business rules.

Programming by pure functions helps achieving **higher degrees of parallelism**: when
state is immutable it can be safely shared between threads and processes without
the need for locks.

Programming by pure functions helps being **concise and expressive** through higher order
functions; as an example, given a list of objects of type Person, compare:

```java
List<String> names = new ArrayList<String>();
for (Iterator<Person> it = persons.iterator(); it.hasNext(); ) {
  names.add(it.next().getName());
}
```

```scala
val names = persons.map(_.name)
```

A program written with pure functions is **easier to follow and to reason about**.

Functional languages often exhibit **very advanced type systems** that help ensuring
correctness.
